# Hirezen

> *One of the emerging millennial industries resulting from the rise of the internet in India and other developed nations is home services. They offer services in-home so that a client is spared the hassle of looking for a qualified service provider outside. Urban Company and Just Dial have become household names for those living in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and others over the past several years because to their ability to provide genuine and reasonably priced services at home.*
> <br/>
> *Even while these services are excellent, they are only available in Tier 1 Indian cities, leaving customers and service providers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns in the dark. This places this group of clients in the position of having problems locating a suitable home maintenance option. Additionally, this prevents the service providers from reaching a much wider customer base in a situation of healthy competition. We look into the reasons why businesses haven't entered this industry and also examine the demands and requirements for such a solution in order to capitalise on this enormous untapped potential. Next, we also suggest a remedy for the aforementioned issue in the shape of Hirezen, a deep learning-powered MERN stack web application that serves as a uniform platform for both customers and service providers.*
> <br/>
> *With features like keyword sorting, sorting based on reviews and ratings, an AI-driven recommendation system, and an email support system, this project will assist us in offering inhabitants of such cities a one-stop solution for providing and utilising home services. A rapid and fast platform that can be viewed on any device at any time has been created using the most up-to-date web development technologies and deep learning algorithms.*
