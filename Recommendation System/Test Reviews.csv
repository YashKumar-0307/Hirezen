Chaos. Food barely warm. Cooks cannot keep up.. This place needs competent cooks. Never coming back.,1

Not a restaurant but a bar with food. Hope they do better at the bar since the food is deplorable. Just saying.,1
Worst pizza and worst service ever!,1

I like the atmosphere in the restaurant but the food is terrible.  I was shocked at how bad the pizza was.,2
don't get anything besides cheesecake unless you wanna get fat and lose your good 401k,2
The veggies were boiled. Boiled! There was too much balsamic syrup on the not fresh fish - to mask the not fresh fish.,2

Restaurant is very clean who was delicious have steak and veggies with sweet tea very fast and friendly service,2

The food is not very good. The only thing nice is the environment.,2
"Super slow service, ""salads"" are not very good and really over priced. Won't be returning.",2
Right flavor but the mac & cheese was gooey and undercooked. I would not recommend this place as a visitor.,2
Not sure if it's right that sushi was warm when it came to the table. Service was sloooooooow.,2
Came in looking for housewares and furniture.  Didn't find anything worth buying.,2
Just personal preference i guess but there was too much sauce so it was all goopy and too overpowering of a flavour. .,2
"Clear your schedule! Its gonna take a while.  I had an omelet, it was just ok.",2
"点了四个菜 没一个好吃的 不适合中国人吃

口水鸡鸡肉不新鲜

酸豆角炒肉沫做的超级咸
松鼠鱼中规中矩，但卖27块钱也不便宜

总的来说就是又油又咸，吃完了以后要不停喝水。",2
Ordered a medium well burger. Came out medium rare. Ate the edges. Waitress apologized but didn't offer a thing.,2
The food is expensive and subpar and the drinks are the size of a vegas bomb. Save your money.,2
Very slow service for a very simple order. Food quality was average compared to other KFCs.,2
This is no where near as good as Tony Angelo's and way overpriced.,2

Slow Service
Rude Staff
Food's Hit or Miss
Good Luck even getting water here",2
"Burger patties lacked in flavor, Cajun Fries were under cooked.  Staff was real nice.",2
"Not so impressed.

Seared tuna was good, but just a bit weird atmosphere.",2
I think 312 refers to the number of minutes you'll wait before getting your food.,2
I'm being generous for giving them two stars. The lady working at the front was super rude.,2
"Just changed their hours to evenings only, 5 days a week.  As I was there to try the lunch menu I am pretty disappointed.",2
Not a fan. Service was decent but the food was not hot and did not taste good. My husband and I have not been back since.,2
"Terrible layout of mall, no sense in where is what. Few good shops. Destination point only.",2
It's FREEZING in the building and the employees said they can't control the temperature. You can hang meat in this place!,2
"Just average.  Pizza crust, while giving all the appearance of a true VPN, was tough and chewy.  Disappointing.",2
Very slow.. if you on your lunch brake you might have to consider to go someplace else.,2
Not impressed. Food was not impressive - would recommend only based on price. Taste isn't there.,2
Service almost non-existent.  Breakfast was cooked too long and came out a little crispy!,2

Ok pizza-Margarita pie was burnt! I mean charred. They brought a new one a bit late . Never got bread. Not sure I'll go back...,2
"Meh. Not bad, but not very good either. I love Mexican food, but would not return here by choice. Can't recommend.",2
Somehow 45 minute routine service turned into 2 hours.  I don't think I'll be coming back.,2
"Sides seem to be their forte. They are good. Sadly, Ribs are fatty and tough-do not fall off bone. So only 2 stars",2
Food was good overall. Not sure why we had to wait 30 minutes till we got it. Took way to long.,2
"Desolate. Uninspiring. Depressing. 
The employees are very attentive and polite. I give them 4 stars. 
The food? 1 star. Boring.",2
Does not have ramen. Only half the menu on here is correct. They have sushi and that's it.,2

Poor selection in small vegetable section. 
No deli section.",2
The staff was very friendly and the food was quick but disgusting. I had fish tacos and will not be going back,2
So much hype with ehh delivery. The biscuits and gravy were SO hard and lacking flavor.,2
"I really, really don't like Karaoke.   It's really more of a meat market for recent divorcees I think.  Not my kind of place.",2
Good flavors but WAY too salty and pricey. And the portion at the new Cheu Noodle at Wholefoods is ridiculous for the price.,2
Great atmosphere. Service was so so. Food was not good. Rubbery calamari. Bread and oil on table was plain. Red sauce was bland.,2
Decent food but gave me indigestion from another planet i swear.  Do yourself a favor and just microwave a frozen acme pizza,2

"They are a so, so when it comes to customer service. I feel as though they often low ball but what pawn shop doesn't?",2
"Typical Sushi Chain, You should not expect anything special. Standard, boring quality.",2
I probably won't be ordering anything from here any more with the new delivery system. Sorry too inconvenient.,2
The meat dumplings were good everything else was bland. I ordered enough for lunch tomorrow but threw it out.,2
Improvement is slow.  Food is same but at least they have a few friendlier people.  I wish they offered some specials.,2
Not a retail location.  Came up on a Sat morning. Closed?? This looks more like a dentist office then a juice shop.,2
Way overpriced for overly seasoned and mediocre food. $14 for two chicken enchiladas...,2
"Service：so，so. I already finished my meat, without rice. 
Food : the fired pork is overheated, so dry",2

Support you local mom & pop pizza places they are much better.,2
"Service & atmosphere are great, the food is particularly bland. Portions are large but flavor is lacking.",2
Greasy horrible breakfast food.   Low quality. Food.  Downhill since what it use to be  just cheap breakfast food.,2
American Spirits has a good selection but likely the least friendly staff you'll ever meet. I go here purely out of convenience.,2
Haircut was good. Attitude of female stylist was disappointing and pretentious. I won't be coming back solely because of this.,2
Chicken tacos too bland but good beer.,2
"Just went to hit some balls. A large bucket is $14, so I literally walked out. Plus, you can only hit off mats.",2
Work was fine but far more expensive than expected. Jeez.,2
"When asked if they are a stand alone store, the gal had no idea.  How stupid can you get.",2

Friendly host staff... Server basically assumed women know nothing about beer and overall horrendous service for mediocre beer.,2
"I get what they are doing, but just wasn't a fan of their ice consistency or flavor of the juice.  Sorry.",2
"Used to love this place, but I don't know what happened. Sub-par food and not great service",2
Not worth the 300+ a night they were charging.  When up the street to the Kempton Hotel for same price and stayed in luxury.,2
"It's too loud in there, hard to carry on a conversation. Until they bring the noise level down, I won't back.",2

Waiter was Missing most of the time.
Dessert was disgusting.
Bar/Drinks are fun and hopping.",2
"They only take CASH...NO debit cards. Bummer! Needless to sau, had to turn right around and leave. Next time I will have cash",2

This is a bar not a 4+ star eatery. Know that going in. Food so-so. Loud and noisy. We endured lunch,2
Come on hoosiers. Boba tea is supposed to be brewed tea that is mixed with milk. It should not come from a bin of powder.,2

Waited over 20 minutes for our table even tough we had reservations.  Food wasn't all that.,2

"When all your employees have ear buds, listening to Spotify, it's not a good look.  Maybe that's why my order was late.",2
Not that good. Low quality. Typical beach joint. Steam bucket only half full. Shrimp over cooked. Service is average.,2
McDonalds of Pizza minus the dollar menu but if you got 5$ and want pizza might as well.  It's a step up from a hot pocket.,2

The food is good and cheap but the customer service needs some BIG improvements.,2
"Takeout was basically thrown in my box, but  dining in was fine. It's outback, take it for what you will",2
Somehow this carmalitas is not as good as the one up the street on east bay. Not quite as fresh and just seems dark in there.,2
The dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been in. They do seem super busy so hoping that they were just understaffed today.,2
"walked in, waited for customer service, not greeted, had questions, the clerk were busy... to busy for customers....",2
Aside from having a private party room I see little reason to go there.  The food's just okay.  I've had better.,2
"The Mama's really good spaghetti and meatballs pasta was not ""Really Good."" Hardly any sauce, and the sauce was really boring.",2
Was in the area and never been so stoped in. Glad i got this one off my list. Had nothing i would go back for.,2
Just ok. Nothing special going on here except the service which is excellent! Food I'd mediocre at best,2
"It has a decent beer selection, but it can get very smokey: too much smoke in the air for me.",2
They mess up my order every time I call one in. They need to focus less on speed of service and more on accuracy.,2
"Popular place. Large servings.  Avoid the omelets, but the other breakfast entrees look good.  Lots of flies in the dining room.",2
"Got a wonderful burger on a soggy, white Wonder Bread-type bun--didn't taste like any brioche I've ever had. Very disappointing.",2

"Average at best. 
Reminded me if cafeteria food from a hospital or school. 

Better places to go in the quarter.",2
The food doesn't match the prices. The donuts look delicious but honestly were really just okay. I won't be returning.,2
Completely over rated. Small selection of donuts with toppings and they didn't taste that great.,2
Food was good and tasty and reasonably priced but my god please clean your bathrooms!!!,2

"The owners need to fix the place up, the food is good though the employees are nice but not as efficient.",2
My friend ordered beef chow mein and a dish came out that resembled fritos chips... nuff said..,2

"It's worse than I thought
Their ""chicken"" is processed stuff
Fake chewy ""meat"" -- Yech!",2

Short staffed so unable to serve properly the menu said homemade biscuits and gravy but both were canned.,2
"Foods good but, there is not seating and it's very loud. They ran out of ciabatta buns.",2
Good service.  The food was just OK.  Good enough for a quick seafood fix.  No oysters???,2
"Done and done. Won't come back. Poor food. Poor service. Ridiculously expensive for what you get. Sorry..3 strikes, you are out.",2
"If your in a hurry, this is not the place to come. Took 12 minutes from taking my order to getting my coffee.",2
"If you like liquid smoke ! ‍
Ok food, ok everything... there's better around that is forsure.",2
These burgers aren't good. In n out is way better and cheaper. The fries are good tho,2
Wait staff was very friendly but my buttermilk waffle was overcooked and didn't really have a flavor. Bacon was good.,2
"This place was ok, I guess.  I have definitely had better coffee and the hot chocolate was way too sweet.",2
Simply put...it is NOT the best Korean Fried Chicken in town. Try Wing Chix and see the difference.,2
"Went with a group of people, it was an ok time. In my opinion this place is a bit overrated. But for $12 not a bad show",2
"Loud. Food was underwhelming. My banana split was not a banana split, and was mostly just chocolate ice cream.",2

Can't wait to try it when it's open.

Hopefully the ice cream machine works too.",2

They need to bring back the scale. The prices of the different size cups are not worth it.,2
I ordered the five meat platter. Looked like a plate of fat. Good service though. Nachos were ok.,2

"Simply said: the quality of this hotel does not justify the price.

Oh and parking is a pain at night.",2

Nice park. Stars deducted for being named after a financial institution.,3
Super young crowd. I guess you get what you pay for but the $10 all you can drink includes only the crappiest liquor.,3
Aldine is on the 2nd floor and not wheelchair accessible.  This is not noted on Yelp.,3
